#twc-chip8

twc-chip8 is a C++14 port of the Bluecodelf/tw-chip8 repository.
It should support the same things, with the same tools (although with some implementation changes to make the code more idiomatic, and more fragmented tools thanks to the CMake build system).

## Why?

I decided to program the same project twice with different languages to investigate the advantages and inconvenients of both.
I'll probably publish my findings somewhere once both projects are done.
